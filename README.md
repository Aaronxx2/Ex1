<h1 style="font-size: 2.5em; color: darkblue;">Ex1 - Foundations of Functional Programming & Testing</h1>

<p>This project is part of the Introduction to Computer Science course at Ariel University. The goal of the project is to implement a calculator for numbers in bases in the range [2,16] with a given file structure.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; color: darkgreen;">Project Structure:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ex1.java</strong>: Contains the implementation of all static functions required for the assignment.</li>
  <li><strong>Ex1Main.java</strong>: Provides a main method to interact with the program.</li>
  <li><strong>Ex1Test.java</strong>: Includes JUnit tests to validate the implementation of the methods in Ex1.java.</li>
</ul>

<p>To run the tests, open the project in an IDE with JUnit support and execute the test suite in Ex1Test.java.</p>
